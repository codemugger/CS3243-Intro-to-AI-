# CS3243-Intro-to-AI-
Intro to AI is a module that I took during my Special Term Part 2 in June 2022 which culminates with a 2 + 1 (Bonus) Projects that students must do, apart from learning the theories, practical stuffs and all.

By the end of this class, students will be familiar with:
	1. the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence
	2. basic agent design principles
	3. the fundamental properties of various search algorithms
	4. agent logic
	5. Bayesian networks (via independent learning)
