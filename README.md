# CS3243-Intro-to-AI-
Intro to AI is a module that I took during my Special Term Part 2 in June 2022 which culminates with a 2 + 1 (Bonus) Projects that students must do, apart from learning the theories, practical stuffs and all.

By the end of this class, students will be familiar with:
	1. the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence
	2. basic agent design principles
	3. the fundamental properties of various search algorithms
	4. agent logic
	5. Bayesian networks (via independent learning)

*Personally I feel these modules are pivotal for one to better understand the AI Concepts:* 
1. Coding Proficiency (CS1010S) 
if "cs1010s" in modules_taken:
	return good_to_go
else:
	return "gg.com"
	
2. CS1231 (Logics and Structures) 
E.g.: Consistency implies Admissibility. But does the latter imply the former? Probably not due to converse error. 

4. CS2040 (Discrete Structures and Algorithms)
ADTs and graph searches like BFS,DFS,UCS

6. CS3244 (Machine Learning) -Fun fact given by my Professor: ML is a subset of AI!- ~SURPRISED!~ 
Refer to my BERT Model Repository to have an idea of application of ML, a subset of Artificial Intelligence! 

Inside this repository will contain my solutions to the stipulated 2 projects. I may or may not do the 3rd project given the tight deadline during the Special Term. Now that I have given you the disclaimer, please forgive me if my projects ain't perfect. Still a learner and a code mugger 🥺🙏🏻
