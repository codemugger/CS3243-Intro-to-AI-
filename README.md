# CS3243-Intro-to-AI-
Intro to AI is a module that I took during my Special Term Part 2 in June 2022 which culminates with a 2 + 1 (Bonus) Projects that students must do, apart from learning the theories, practical stuffs and all.

By the end of this class, students will be familiar with:
	1. the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence
	2. basic agent design principles
	3. the fundamental properties of various search algorithms
	4. agent logic
	5. Bayesian networks (via independent learning)

Personally I feel these modules are pivotal for one to better understand the AI Concepts:
1. Coding Proficiency (CS1010S)
2. CS1231 (Logics and Structures) 
3. CS2040 (Discrete Structures and Algorithms)
4. CS3244 (Machine Learning) -Fun fact given by my Professor: ML is a subset of AI!- ~SURPRISED!~ 

Inside this repository will contain my solutions to the stipulated 2 projects. I may or may not do the 3rd project given the tight deadline during the Special Term. Now that I have given you the disclaimer, please forgive me if my projects ain't perfect. Still a learner and a code mugger ü•∫üôèüèª
